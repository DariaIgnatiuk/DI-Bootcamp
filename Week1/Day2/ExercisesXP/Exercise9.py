""" Exercise 9: Cinemax
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.
Ask a family the age of each person who wants a ticket.
Store the total cost of all the familyâ€™s tickets and print it out. """
