""" Exercise 2 : Cinemax #2
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.
Given the following object:
family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
How much does each family member have to pay ?
Print out the familys total cost for the movies.
Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family 
variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary 
that is initially empty). """
